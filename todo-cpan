 - currently using Module::Build
    - with really ugly c&p
 - switch to Dist::Zilla if possible
 - build step should only need to rewrite WebGUI::Paths
 - should run without needing build
 - dist tarball doesn't need to though

 - need prompt / option for etc dir
    - created during install
    - spectre and log configs created during install
 - add site creation command
    - db admin or existing db
    - uploads path
    - config name
 - tests
    - need temp database
    - can't use real etc, need temp or workaround
 - still want to slim down extras
 - move all commands to modules
